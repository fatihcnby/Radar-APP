<h1>Radar-APP</h1>

I used API that shows all planes over an area of your choice.

In the application, you can access information such as aircraft information, takeoff and landing information.

Other frameworks I use for design;

- @reduxjs/toolkit

- React-redux

- Axios

- Bootstrap

- Leaflet

- React-leaflet

- React-paginate
